|Howdy, #{@notification.user.display_name}!
br
br
| You recently attempted to verify your bank account <b>#{customer.bank_account_name}</b> on Neighbor.ly and were unable to confirm the two deposits we made to your account. We will now restart the verification process.
br
ul
  li Two deposits (each less than $1.00) will be placed in your account and should appear in your bank statement within 1-2 business days.
  li Once the deposits have been made, you will receive an email with a link to verify your account using the two deposit amounts.

|High fives,
