|Howdy, #{contribution.user.name}!
br
br
|Unfortunately, the project #{link_to(contribution.project.name, "#{Configuration[:base_url]}/projects/#{contribution.project.to_param}")} did not reach its goal and will not be funded on #{Configuration[:company_name]}.
br
br
|We see that you began your contribution process a few days ago. If you did <strong>not</strong> complete the transaction process, please disregard this email.
br
br
| If you completed your transaction but did not receive an email confirmation from RaiseanAim, you should receive one within a few days.
br

br
|When we've received confirmation of your contribution, you will receive credits in the amount of #{contribution.display_value} that can be used toward any project on RaiseanAim.
br
br
|If you prefer, you may request a refund of your contribution by clicking #{link_to("here", "#{Configuration[:base_url]}/users/#{contribution.user.to_param}#credits")}.
|  If you have any problems with this process, please email #{mail_to Configuration[:email_payments]} with the subject "Problem With Refund"
br
br
|When requesting a refund of a payment made with a credit card, please keep in mind, as laid out in our #{link_to 'Terms of Use', "#{Configuration[:base_url]}/terms"}, the amount will be reversed in the next card billing statement. If the contribution was made through e-check, please send an email to #{mail_to Configuration[:email_payments]}.
br
br
|If you for any reason you would like to contact #{contribution.project.user.display_name}, please email them at #{mail_to contribution.project.user.email}.
br
br
|If you have any other questions, please access our #{link_to 'FAQ', "#{Configuration[:base_url]}/faq"}.
