|Howdy, #{project.user.name},
br
|Your project has just ended on RaiseanAim. There are still a few last minute payments that are currently being verified. This process may take up to seven days to complete.
br
br
|Not to worry. Most of the time, payments are confirmed without issue. This is only a precaution to ensure your campaign closes with the correct amount of funds collected.
br
br
|Thank You,
br
|The #{Configuration[:company_name]} Team
